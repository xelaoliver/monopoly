Project from March 30-ongoing

Has: (as of March 30)
- 3D rendering
- Easy player movement for when adding multiplayer

Doesn't have:
- All the rest

# Version 3:

This project is still undergoing, with a proper server! It's hosted on your WiFi network so it won't work to connect different clients with different IPs, but in schools/cafes/librarys it should work solid.
